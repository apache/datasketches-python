HyperLogLog (HLL)
-----------------
This is a high performance implementation of Phillipe Flajolet's HLL sketch but with significantly improved error behavior.

If the ONLY use case for sketching is counting uniques and merging, the HLL sketch is a reasonable choice, although the highest performing in terms of accuracy for storage space consumed is CPC (Compressed Probabilistic Counting). For large enough counts, this HLL version (with HLL_4) can be 2 to 16 times smaller than the Theta sketch family for the same accuracy.

This implementation offers three different types of HLL sketch, each with different trade-offs with accuracy, space and performance. 
These types are specified with the target_hll_type parameter.

In terms of accuracy, all three types, for the same lg_config_k, have the same error distribution as a function of `n`, the number of unique values fed to the sketch.
The configuration parameter `lg_config_k` is the log-base-2 of `k`, where `k`` is the number of buckets or slots for the sketch.

During warmup, when the sketch has only received a small number of unique items (up to about 10% of `k`), this implementation leverages a new class of estimator algorithms with significantly better accuracy.
